.. warning::

    Ansible-Readme in current form is meant primarily as an unstable
    proof-of-concept tool. The project does follow `Semantic versioning`_
    conventions but there are no guarantees that certain approaches will
    continue to be supported on major releases. Therefore it is advised to not
    invest in using the tool to document your roles **just yet** until it is
    clear what approaches are worth following.
